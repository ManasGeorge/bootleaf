CA DMV Appointment Finder
========

### Introduction

This is a fork of the excellent [Bootleaf](https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf) code written by [Bryan McBride](https://github.com/bmcbride), which incorporates the responsive framework [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) with the lightweight [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) mapping API. The original code is changed to show CA DMVs alongside the earliest appointment times for each DMV, updated twice a day.
